# ProgressBot
A small progress tracking bot I made for my class server.

I teach my classmates coding sometimes after school.

## Installation and running
Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) if you haven't already.

Download and unpack the repo or use `git`
```
git clone https://github.com/Wolfyxon/ProgressBot.git
```

Then in the downloaded repository, run
```
npm i
```
and wait for the dependencies to install.

After that, run the bot
```
npm run dev
```

If you want to run it in production, use
```
npm run build
```
and
```
npm run start
```
